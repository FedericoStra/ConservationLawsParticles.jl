	abstract = {We develop deterministic particle schemes to solve nonlocal
	            scalar conservation laws with congestion. We show that the
	            discrete approximations converge to the unique entropy solution
	            under more general assumptions than the existing literature: the
	            velocity fields are allowed to be time-dependent (with no
	            regularity in time), they are allowed to be less regular in space
	            (in particular the interaction force can have a discontinuity at
	            the origin), no prescribed attractive/repulsive regimes or
	            symmetry are required, and the mobility can have unbounded
	            support. We treat in a unified manner two different schemes, with
	            sampled and integrated interaction, showing that they both
	            converge to the entropy solution, albeit with different
	            trade-offs between accuracy and computational effort. We
	            complement our results with some numerical simulations, among
	            which we show the applicability to the multispecies setting, for
	            which the integrated scheme appears to be the better choice.},

	            datum, the space-time dependent flux and the entropy
	            inequalities. Such a general stability theorem is motivated by
	            the study of problems in which the flux \(P[u](t,x,u)\) depends
	            possibly non-locally on the solution itself. For these problems
	            we show the conditional existence and uniqueness of entropy
	            solutions. Moreover, the relaxation of the entropy inequality
	            allows to treat approximate solutions arising from various
	            numerical schemes. This can be used to derive the rate of
	            convergence of the recent particle method introduced in Radici

	            known rates for some other approximation methods.},
